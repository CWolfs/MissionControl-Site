I'm Richard 'CWolf' Griffiths. I'm a developer at a small games company called [Rogue Vector](https://www.roguevector.com) who also works on projects on the side. My main side projects is modding for BattleTech game and I've created a few useful mods.

If you enjoy my mods and want to support my efforts to bring new content and experiences to BattleTech - feel free to support me by [Buying me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/NFLgCRS).

Another way to support me is to play with Mission Control and provide feedback, bug reports and ideas. You can find me in the [Mission Control discord](https://discord.gg/22raTJh") or any of the main BattleTech game servers (BATTLETECHGAME, RogueTech, BTA3062).
