title: Procedural Contract Types
---

Various custom contract types are added to the game. Initially the logic in the custom contract types will be basic but this will change as the custom contract type system develops.

## Blackout

A point of interest of your employer has gone dark and they're sending you in to investigate. A low intel situation with different situations each time you play.

This contract type introduces unique logic to provide random events at key points in the contract type to increase replayability.

## Solo Duel

A solo duel sets one of your mechs against another solo mech in arena combat. It makes use of the `ShowDown` map from the story campaign contacts.

## Duo Duel

A duo duel sets two of your mechs against another two mechs in arena combat. It makes use of the `ShowDown` map from the story campaign contacts.
