title: Random Spawns
---

Depending on the contract type, the lance spawns will change every playthrough. The spawning uses contract type specific logic to suitably place the lances. There are no configuration options currently available for this as these come from the encounter type rulesets that are created. Which things are randomised in the game is determined by the Encounter Ruleset which is run for that contract type.
