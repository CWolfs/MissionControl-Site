Mission Control works on single player skirmish if a contract type ruleset is created for it, or the 'DebugSkirmishMode' option is turned on (defaults to on).

The 'Quick Skirmish' feature adds a new main menu button. When clicked it will use the last lance the player used for the cost brackets (unlimited selected first and clash last) then it gives the player a random map and mood. It will spawn the player lance and the enemy lance within firing range. This is ideal for modders testing their mods or people who want a very quick skirmish.
