To install Mission Control just:

- Download the mod
- Since the HBS mod loader isn't fully working yet you must use [ModTek](https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek/releases) community mod loader
- Place the mod into your `BATTLETECH/Mods` folder
- Launch BattleTech and ensure 'Mission Control' is enabled in the Mod Loader menu
- Enjoy!
