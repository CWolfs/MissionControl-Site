Mission Control is a HBS BattleTech mod that provides a framework for runtime modifications of the contracts, encounters and other map logic. This includes varying the encounter specifics such as spawn locations, lance numbers, objectives and entirely new contract types.

This can be optionally used with flashpoints, story contract and even to make custom story contracts too!
