Mission Control is a HBS BattleTech mod that provides a framework for runtime modifications of the contracts, encounters and other map logic. This includes varying the encounter specifics such as spawn locations, lance numbers, objectives and entirely new contract types.

This works only for the generic contract types (e.g. Battle, Rescue etc) as it would break the balance for vanilla story missions.
