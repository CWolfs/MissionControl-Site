This release focuses on fixing critical bugs introduced by `v0.4.3`. Mainly fixing the broken campaign, flashpoints and skirmish.

Tracked by [Milestone - v0.4.4](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/milestone/13?closed=1)

For detailed documentation, visit the [Mission Control Website](https://www.missioncontrolmod.com).

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs:
  - Just copy the new `MissionControl.dll`, `cast/Portraits.json` and `mod.json` into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you

## Bugs Fixed

- Campaign / Flashpoints: MC breaks regions logic in campaign and flashpoints. This resulted in completely broken logic in the contracts.
- Skirmish: MC completely broke the loading of Skirmish
- Additional Lances: Portrait config was not set to use the new portraits introduced in `v0.4.3`
