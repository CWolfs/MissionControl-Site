Hi everyone. Since Mission Control has been in development (_June 2018_) it's been steadily growing in features. I felt that it had outgrown simple github `README.md` pages so I've decided to set up a more usable resource for modders and gamers.

Check out the [Documentation](../docs/overview/about) to read about Mission Control's reasoning, features, tutorials and more.

Don't forget to join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/22raTJh) server if you're interested in providing feedback or suggesting features, like new custom contract types.

Also, if you fancy supporting my efforts to bring new content and experiences to BattleTech - feel free to support me by [Buying me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/NFLgCRS).
