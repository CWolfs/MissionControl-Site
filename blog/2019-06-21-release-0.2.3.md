This release focuses on bug fixing and stabilising Mission Control (as it's well known for its long loads and patchy spawn points).

## Improvements

- Map load times are much faster, even in a worst case situation.

## Bugs Fixed

- Fixed infinite load screen wait bugs
- Fixed unit spawns that didn't allow a unit to move
- Fixed units spawning on buildings (urban maps highlighted this bug)
- Fixed 'Follow Player' AI - Between BTv1.4 and BTv1.6.2 a tag was changed that broke this AI
