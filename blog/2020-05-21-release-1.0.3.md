Tracked by [Milestone - v1.0.3](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/milestone/23?closed=1)

## Bug Fixes

- Blackout: `Unknown Cause` didn't spawn an occupying lance in one of the second event phase events

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `mod.json`
    - `overrides/contracts/blackout/Blackout_UnknownCause.json`
