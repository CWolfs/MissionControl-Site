This release fixes a vanilla infinite contracts screen issue relating to original HBS code and restrictive contracts involving lack of faction selection and system restrictions, and a quick skirmish bug.

For upgrade instructions, see below the changelog.

Tracked by [Milestone - v1.0.5](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/milestone/25?closed=1)

## Bug Fixes

- Contracts: Fixed infinite loading screen when faction and system restrictions conflicted with some contract types and contracts (Thanks a lot for the help **Pode**, **Granner** and **Quiller** with debugging this)
- Skirmish: Fixed map loading exception when allies dropped with you

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `mod.json`
