This release fixes a single bug mentioned below that caused an infinite spinner when returning from a contract that didn't have MC running on it.

The full release diff can be at the [v1.5.1 pull request](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/pull/554).

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- [Data Cleanup: RestoreFromCopy cleanup approach caused infinite spinner when MC was not allowed to run](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/552)
  - When Mission Control wasn't running for a contract the data backup wasn't running. When the contract ended the data backup caused an infinite spinner because there was no data to restore and MC errored.

## üÜô Upgrade Instructions

This update is just a dll and mod.json update.

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your Mods/MissionControl folder
    - MissionControl.dll
    - mod.json
