This release fixes broken skirmish and broken mechlab due to MC `v1.1.0` changes.

## Bug Fixes

- Skirmish: Fixed broken skirmish due to lack of testing after contract specific overrides were introduced
- Mechlab: Fixed broken mechlab due to asset bundle work for save game fixes.

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `MissionControl.pdb`
    - `mod.json`
