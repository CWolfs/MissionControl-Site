BT 1.7 forced me to release early to bring in BT 1.7 support. Mainly adds support for this, plus some additional features and minor bug fixes. Any remaining v0.3.1 milestone items are pushed to v0.3.2.

## Major Features

- Added BattleTech 1.7 support
- Added 'Battle+ / Three-Way' contract type support

## Minor Features

- Additional Lances: Support added for mult-folder support under the `MC/lances` directory
- Additional Lances: Support madlibs for lance and unit tags for `MC/lances` configs

## Improvements

- Random Spawns: Made the search algorithm more efficient. It might help with load times a little.

## Bugs Fixed

- Random Spawns: Caught an error that occurs in the pathfinder when the nodes are out of index
