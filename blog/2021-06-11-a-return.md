Hey guys! I'm back!

After 9 or 10 months of burnout I started feeling the itch to get back to some fun programming. Fun programming for me includes modding! I'm going to be taking it slowly but I will be starting to update Mission Control again (and other mod/tool projects) so keep an eye out for fun new things!

And with that, I'm releasing a new update for Mission Control with v1.2.0. Read the changelog for more information and I hope you enjoy it!
