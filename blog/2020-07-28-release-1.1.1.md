This release fixes a broken Additional Player Units / Bigger Drops integration in MC `v1.1.0`.

## Bug Fixes

- Bigger Drops: Fixed broken integration from MC `v1.1.0`.

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `MissionControl.pdb`
    - `mod.json`
