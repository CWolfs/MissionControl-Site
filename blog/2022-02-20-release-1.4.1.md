## üÜô Upgrade Instructions

This update is just a dll and mod.json update.

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your Mods/MissionControl folder
    - MissionControl.dll
    - mod.json
