After many years hosting my mods on Nexus I have decided to remove them and no longer host anything on Nexus Mods. These mods include Mission Control, ConverseTek conversation editor and BTDebug scene inspector.

The reason for this is their (potentially illegal in some countries) decision to take away full control of how a modder's mod is used.

All my mods will still be hosted on Github like usual.

Thanks for your understanding.
