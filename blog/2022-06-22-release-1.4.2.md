This release fixes a bug in Extended Lances and one in Additional Lances.

The full release diff can be at the [v1.4.2 pull request](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/pull/509).

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- [Additional Lances: Elite lances always being used](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/503)
- [Extended Lances: Pilots from EL lances that are expanded are default pilots instead of LanceDef pilots if autofill is not allowed](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/507)
  - This issue would only happen if the EL lance wasn't in autofill mode
  - For any additional units that get expanded from a LanceDef with a pilot would fallback to default
  - Pilots filled from the UnitSpawnPointOverrides that existed in the contract lanec units would fill correctly

## üÜô Upgrade Instructions

This update is just a dll and mod.json update.

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your Mods/MissionControl folder
    - MissionControl.dll
    - mod.json
