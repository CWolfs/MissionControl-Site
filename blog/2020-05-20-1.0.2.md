This release fixes mainly around Blackout contract type bugs and solo/duo duel contract type balances.

## Bug Fixes

- Blackout: Contracts `Heavy Static` and `Unknown Cause` would sometimes not complete successfully
- Blackout: Fixed Dynamic Withdraw feature not working
- Blackout: Various dialogue fixes (Thanks @NickAragua and Cargo)
- Solo/Duo Duel: Fixed issue with vehicles spawning
- Solo Duel: Fixed OpFor selection being too strong/weak
- Additional Lances: Yet another attempt to fix the locale reward issue being 100 times higher than it should
- Additional Lances: Reworked `DropWeightInfluence` to be more inline with the proposal by the RT team
- Extended Lances: Fixed difficulty modifications being processed too late

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `mod.json`
    - `contractTypeBuilds/Blackout/common.jsonc`
    - `overrides/contracts` folder and overwrite all

### Replace `settings.json` section `DropWeightInfluence` with

```json
"DropWeightInfluence": {
  "Enable": false,
  "EnemySpawnInfluencePerHalfSkullAbove": 0.1,
  "AllySpawnInfluencePerHalfSkullAbove": -0.1,
  "EnemySpawnInfluencePerHalfSkullBelow": 0.1,
  "AllySpawnInfluencePerHalfSkullBelow": -0.1
},
```
