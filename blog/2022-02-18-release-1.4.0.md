This release introduces Extended Lances version 2, a major upgrade to Extended Lances, and some minor bugfixes.

The full release diff can be at the [v1.4.0 pull request](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/pull/496).

## ‚ùó Extended Lances v2 Upgrade ‚ùó

As many of the features and fixes are related to EL - I'm drawing attention to it here. Some of the below fixes and improvements for EL v2 are covered below in the main changelog too.

- [Extended Lances v2 Upgrade](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/488)
  - Extended Lances has been given a major upgrade. There were some fundamental issues and limitations with EL that preventing some modders achieving the results they wanted. Now EL should have fewer bugs and more flexibility.
  - Backwards compatible
  - [Extensively tested](/docs/assets/Extended_Lances_v2_Testing.pdf)

## üöÄ Features

- [Extended Lances: Support all other Teams](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/481)
  - EL now supports TargetAlly, EmployerAlly, HostileToAll, NeutralToAll
  - This feature is on by default so modpacks might want to consider game balance
  - Support can be individually turned off in the `settings.json` in the EL section
  - Can be individually overridden with [per-contract overrides](/docs/features/per-contract-overrides)
- [Extended Lances: Provide a way to force EL to allow specific LanceOverride set ups](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/484)
  - A new `settings.json` property called `ForceLanceOverrideSizeWithTag` which controls this behaviour
  - When a LanceOverride (lance in the contract json) has this tag in its `lanceTagSet/tagSetSourceFile` then it will force EL to spawn this exact defined lance
  - `lanceTagSet/tagSetSourceFile` is not used in BattleTech so it's been adopted for this feature
- [Extended Lances: Provide a way to force EL to allow specific LanceDef set ups](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/483)
  - A new `settings.json` property called `ForceLanceDefSizeWithTag` which controls this behaviour
  - When a LanceDef has this tag in its `LanceTags/tagSetSourceFile` then it will force EL to spawn this exact defined lance
  - `LanceTags/tagSetSourceFile` is not used in BattleTech so it's been adopted for this feature
- [Extended Lances: AutofillType setting](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/485)
  - When EL autofills lances it has to decide how to handle units that are defined as empty (mechDef_None, vehicleDef_None)
  - A new `settings.json` property called `AutofillType` which controls this behaviour and it has two settings:
    - `RespectEmpty` is the legacy and still the default behaviour. When a LanceOverride or LanceDef has empty units defined (e.g. mechDef_None, vehicleDef_None) then it will respect those and not autofill them.
    - `FillEmpty`is a new autofill behaviour. When a LanceOverride or LanceDef has empty units defined (e.g. mechDef_None, vehicleDef_None) then it will autofill and replace them so units will spawn in those slots.
- [Extended Lances: AutofillStartingFromContractDifficulty setting](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/494)
  - A new `settings.json` property under `ExtendedLances` called `AutofillStartingFromContractDifficulty `
  - To aid in a fairer early game, you can now control when Extended Lances autofills units in lances that are below the faction's EL `LanceSize` by setting a contract difficulty (real difficulty - not UI/visible difficulty) to start autofilling from
  - This does not affect LanceDefs that fill up to the faction's `LanceSize` themselves (e.g. modpack Clan LanceDefs up to 5 or 6 etc)
  - For those who don't want this feature - set it to `1`
- [Extended Lances: AutofillUnitCopyType setting](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/486)
  - At times EL needs to copy units to create a varied and interesting lance when autofilling it up to the Faction Size (or any overridden size). In this case EL tries to copy a 'Tagged' lance so to use this tagged UnitSpawnPointOverride and leverage the tags to provide variation. If there are no 'Tagged' lances available to copy it will use the defined behaviour in `AutofillUnitCopyType` in the settings.json.
  - A new `settings.json` property called `AutofillUnitCopyType` which controls this behaviour and it has two settings:
    - `FirstInLance` - The legacy behaviour. It would pick the first unit (index 0) and copy it (giving it new identify/clearing custom names etc)
    - `RandomInLance` - The new behaviour and is now the default behaviour. It picks a random unit from the Lance to copy (giving it new identify/clearing custom names etc)

## ‚ö°Improvements

- [Extended Boundaries: Ambush Convoy - Reduce increase from 30% to 20%](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/493)
  - Previously Ambush Convoy boundary increased by 30%. As players sometimes struggle to catch the convoy if the Random Spawn algorithm places them too far away the boundary increase is now reduced slightly to 20%

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- [Extended Lance: LanceOverrides with fewer units than a selected LanceDef didn't populate all LanceDef units](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/482)
- [Extended Lances: LanceDefId being direct reference only added one extra lance instead of EL number](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/472)
- [Random Spawns: Blackout - Opposing Force Orientation Was Wrong](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/478)
- [Additional Lances: Incorrectly handling lanceExcludedTagSet](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/491)
  - MC AL lances incorrectly added `lanceExcludedTagSet` to the `lanceTagSet`. This would cause incorrect lance selection behaviour for MC AL lances with tags
- [Vanilla: When BT copies LanceDefs it didn't maintain the LanceTags 'tagSetSourceFile' data](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/487)
  - When BT copies LanceDefs it would never maintain/preserve the `tagSetSourceFile` property. Since this property is never used in the game it isn't a problem, however, Since ELv2 uses it - it has been fixed

## üÜô Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your Mods/MissionControl folder
    - MissionControl.dll
    - mod.json
    - config/Contracts/My_Contract_ID_Example.json
    - config/Contracts/My_FP_Contract_ID_Example.json

Add the following to your `settings.json`:

### Under `ExtendedLances` add:

```json
"EnableForTargetAlly": true,
"EnableForEmployerAlly": true,
"EnableForHostileToAll": true,
"EnableForNeutralToAll": true,
"AutofillType": "RespectEmpty",
"AutofillUnitCopyType": "RandomInLance",
"AutofillStartingFromContractDifficulty": 3,
"ForceLanceOverrideSizeWithTag": "mc_force_extended_lance",
"ForceLanceDefSizeWithTag": "mc_force_extended_lance",
```

and update to have `mc_no_extended_lance`:

```json
"SkipWhenExcludeTagsContain": ["mc_no_extended_lance", "no_extended_lance"],
```

### Under `ExtendedBoundaries/Overrides` add:

```json
{
  "ContractTypeName": "AmbushConvoy",
  "IncreaseBoundarySizeByPercentage": 0.2
