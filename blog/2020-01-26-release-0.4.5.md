This release focuses on fixing bugs introduced by `v0.4.4`.

Tracked by [Milestone - v0.4.5](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/milestone/16?closed=1)

## Upgrade Instructions

* If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
* If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs:
  * Just copy the new `MissionControl.dll` and `mod.json` into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
* If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you

## Changes

* Additional Lances: Reduced the lance reward from 150% to 75%.

## Bugs Fixed

* Original Flashpoints: MC runs for original flashpoints regardless of the `settings.json` option. This doesn't affect Heavy Metal flashpoints.
