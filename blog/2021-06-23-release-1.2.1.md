This is a minor bug fix release for some edge case bugs.

## Minor Features

- [Infinite Loading: Contracts with Abandoned Flashpoints](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/440)
  - If a Flashpoint was abandoned then it still remains the `ActiveFlashpoint` in the game. Due to this an assumption I made causes a crash as an abandoned flashpoint doesn't have any active contracts

## Improvements

- [Exposed Lance Divergence check values in the settings](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/425)
  - Required for support amongst the various modpacks as one solution doesn't fit all

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `mod.json`
    - Edit `settings.json` (and/or your `settings.user.json` / `settings.modpack.json` overrides) with the following:

#### Add the following `Misc` block under the top-level `Spawners` block

```json
  "Misc": {
    "LanceSelectionDivergenceOverride": {
      "Enable": true,
      "Divergence": 20
    }
  }
```

**Specific for RT modpack**

For RT modpack authors, or any modpack that uses custom high difficulty value lances like RT, use this block instead (or experiment with much higher divergence values):

```json
  "Misc": {
    "LanceSelectionDivergenceOverride": {
      "Enable": false
    }
  }
```
