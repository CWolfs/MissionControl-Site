This is the first release after my break. This fixes a few issues that have been hanging over me since I was away.

This release adds some balance and fixes.

## Minor Features

- [Bigger Drops: Support extra player lances in Story & Restoration contracts](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/413)
  - A new `settings.json` property called `EnableAdditionalPlayerMechsForStory` which controls this behaviour
- [Story Support: Support the full set of MC features in Story & Restoration contracts](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/428)
  - A new `settings.json` property called `EnableStoryOverrides` exists. When this is enabled MC will look into each `settings.json` feature section for the `EnableForStory` property to decide if a feature should be running in Story & Restoration contracts
  - Incororated a fix by @mcb5637. Thanks.
  - **Using these features will severly unbalance the Story and I will not support tweaks to it**

## Improvements

- [Blackout: Changed the 'Trap' event in Phase 1 to reduce evasion by 2 instead of 3](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/432)
  - Players take less of an evasion hit from the trap
- [Better Skirmish Control](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/430)
  - You can now use MC with Skirmish without the debug / quick skirmish rules (this means no longer spawning right next to each other)
  - A new `settings.json` property called `EnableSkirmishMode` which controls if this MC Skirmish ruleset is running
  - `DebugSkirmishMode` still exists and will spawn you next to the enemy for tests. It will also show the 'Quick Skirmish' button if enabled, and takes precedent over `EnableSkirmishMode`
- [Vanilla: Support Story Flashpoints to be failable](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/434)
  - Previously when failing a Story Flashpoint you would see the 'Restart', 'Load Save' or 'Exit Game' menu
  - You now can safely fail the contract
  - If for whatever reason you don't want this behaviour then you can use the setting `"NeverFailSimGameInFlashpoints": false` in the `settings.json`

## Bug Fixes

- [Flashpoints: Fixed Flashpoint support not working](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/419)
  - Fixed `EnableAdditionalPlayerMechsForFlashpoints` not working at all
  - Fixed `EnableFlashpointOverrides` and the respective `EnableForFlashpoints` property not working at all
  - **I'm aware of the workaround using contract-specific overrides and this is no longer needed to workaround this issue anymore**
- [Additional Lances: Fixed broken drop weight influence setting](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/426)
  - The 'DropWeightInfluence` was broken and always thinking the player was dropping a lance heavier than the contract
  - This would effectively scale up the difficulty of the enemy Additional Lances dropping against you
  - Some modpacks were using a patched version of Mission Control I released to fix this issue since Sept 2020
- [Vanilla: Fixed issue with certain contracts preventing the dropship UI appearing after failing them](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/435)
  - This happened with a contract using `Contract_IgnoreMissionResults` in the `OnContractFailureResults` section
  - It would run vanilla code that was broken
- [Infinite Loading: Fixed a rare issue where no suitable lance could be selected when loading a contract/combat](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/425)
  - Thanks for the fix @Haree78

## Deprecations

- `EncounterRules.GetPlayerLanceChunkName()` will be removed in the future. Use `EncounterRules.GetPlayerLanceChunkGameObject(GameObject encounterLayerGo)` instead
- `EncounterRules.GetPlayerLanceSpawnerName()` will be removed in the future. Use `EncounterRules.GetPlayerSpawnerGameObject(GameObject chunkPlayerLanceGo)` instead

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `mod.json`
    - `contractTypeBuilds/Blackout/common.jsonc`
    - Edit `settings.json` (and/or your `settings.user.json` / `settings.modpack.json` overrides) with the following:

#### Add `EnableSkirmishMode` property above `DebugSkirmishMode` and set to 'true'

Enables the new Skirmish encounter ruleset

```json
"EnableSkirmishMode": true,
```

#### Disable `DebugSkirmishMode` property

Enables the new Skirmish encounter ruleset

```json
"DebugSkirmishMode": false,
```

#### Add the following properties after `EnableAdditionalPlayerMechsForFlashpoints`

```json
"NeverFailSimGameInFlashpoints": true,
"EnableStoryOverrides": false,
"EnableAdditionalPlayerMechsForStory": false,
```

#### Add `EnableForStory` in every feature section under `EnableForFlashpoints` property and set to 'false'

Do this for:

- HotDropProtection
- AdditionalLances
- ExtendedLances
- ExtendedBoundaries
- DynamicWithdraw

```json
"EnableForStory": false,
```
