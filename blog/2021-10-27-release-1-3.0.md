This release fixes various bugs and adds various enhancements.

The full release diff can be seen [here](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/pull/459/files)

## Bug Fixes

- [Story Support: Fixed Boundary Detection Issue](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/444)
  - Improved how the boundary game object is grabbed for boundary related processing
- [Duo Duel: Fixed broken player pilot death prevention system](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/445)
  - Fixed `YearlyTussle` and `FestiveCouple`'s player pilot death prevention system
- [Additional Lances: Fixed cases where direct LanceDef references failed](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/452)
  - Sometimes if a direct LanceDef was used and it was not already loaded in memory it would fail and not grab it from the file system
- [Contract Types; Fixed various non-critical spelling mistakes in Blackout, Solo Duel and Duo Duel](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/458)

## Improvements

- [Additional Lances: Added a per-contract override to manually specify the Additional Lance(s) dropping](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/450)
  - This acts as a middle ground between dynamic AL and custom contract types. You can use a per-contract override for your contract and manually specify the dropping ally and enemy Additional Lances
- [Additional Lances: Support higher than difficulty 10 for config files](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/446)
  - MC used to only look for AL config `difficulty1.json` up to `difficulty10.json`. Now it has unlimited search for difficulties.
- [Additional Lances: Added Drop Weight Influence maximum influence caps](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/448)
  - Added an absolute max value for Drop Weight Influence Enemy and Ally settings that an influence value can go to.
- [Contract Type Builder: Improved 'Mount On' positioning](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/455)
- [Contract Type Builder: Added customer MC trigger support for Dialogues](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/456)
- [Contract Types: Added optimisation for contract selection related to custom contract types](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/457)

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `mod.json`
    - `config/Contracts/My_FP_Contract_ID_Example.json`
    - `contractTypeBuilds/Blackout/common.jsonc`
    - `contractTypeBuilds/Blackout/mountainhold_lunar.jsonc `
    - `contractTypeBuilds/DuoDuel/common.jsonc`
    - `contractTypeBuilds/SoloDuel/common.jsonc`
    - `overrides/contracts/duoduel/DuoDuel_FestiveCouple.json`
    - `overrides/contracts/duoduel/DuoDuel_YearlyTussle.json`
    - Edit `settings.json` (and/or your `settings.user.json` / `settings.modpack.json` overrides) with the following:

#### Add the following under the `AdditionalLances/DropWeightInfluence` block

```json
"EnemySpawnInfluenceMax": 0.9,
"AllySpawnInfluenceMax": 0.9,
```

**Specific for RT modpack**

Since you had an early release with the Drop Weight Influence maximum - no need to change your custom config for that feature.
