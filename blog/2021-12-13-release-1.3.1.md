## Bug Fixes

- [Duo Duel: Fixed broken player pilot death prevention system](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/445)
  - Fixed `FestiveCouple`'s player pilot death prevention system again
  - This wasn't fully fixed in v1.3.0 for `FestiveCouple`
- [Additional Lances: Fixed Support Lance objective starting at '2' instead of '1'](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/461)

## Improvements

- [ModTek v2 Support: Added support for ModTek v2](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/467)
- [Improved Deferred Loading of Assets](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/463)
  - Older system didn't care what else was loading. Now properly checks to fit itself in between other assets loading
- [Improved CAC Compatibility](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/465)
  - Fixed a very rare situation where loading of assets by MC could deadlock loading careers or skirmish

## Upgrade Instructions

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your `Mods/MissionControl` folder
    - `MissionControl.dll`
    - `mod.json`
    - `overrides/contracts/duoduel/DuoDuel_FestiveCouple.json`
