This release introduces a lot of new features and fixes some important bugs. It adds a lot more content for the existing custom contract types, adds a dialogue system that works with the combat dialogue for much more control and allows player pilots to talk in contracts. One of the main reasons for this release is to prepare the contract type build formats for the upcoming Mission Control Designer.

All website documentation has been updated to reflect all the new additions and changes so check there for specifics.

The full release diff can be at the [v1.5.0 pull request](#).

## ‚ùó Custom Contract Build Format Upgrade

As the Mission Control Designer is in a functional state I've been testing the Designer saving out the existing custom contract types (Duels & Blackout). For various reasons related to the Designer the existing custom contract type build files (files that are located under `MissionControl/contractTypeBuilds`) require an upgrade.

**The upgrade is critical and must be done. See the below Upgrade instructions on the process**

- [Dialogue: Dialogue can reference Commander, Speaker, Bound or Position Player Pilots](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/533)

- [Dialogue: Conditional dialogue - the ability to show dialogue on certain conditions](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/544)
  - Supports checks against Employer or Target Faction Type

  - Helps fix vanilla BT annoyance with Faction names starting lowercase so faction names can now be correctly used at the start of sentences.
- [Per-Contract Override - Additional Lances - Support Enabling / Disabling UseDialogue](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/528)
  - Allows modders to remove the Ally mission start dialogue for AL lances at a contract level
- [Per-Contract Override - Additional Lances - Support Custom Objective Names](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/526)
  - Allows modders to provide custom names for the Enemy AL lances
  - Fewer objective names can be provided than AL lances and if the names aren't enough it fallsback to the default names
- [Per-Contract Override - Additional Lances - Support CastDef](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/530)
  - Allows modders to provide a custom CastDef id and that Cast will speak the mission start dialogue for Ally AL lances
  - CastDef id can be a Mission Control dynamic CastDef id as mentioned in the new `Dialogue` features
- [Per-Contract Override - Additional Lances - Support Custom Dialogue](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/530)]
  - Allows modders to provide custom dialogue for the Ally AL lance to speak at the mission start dialogue

  - This will override every other AL lance approach
  - Usable only for procedural contracts and not available for Flashpoints and Story contracts
- [Metrics](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/515)
  - Added a way for other mods to access some Mission Control data
  - Accessed through `MissionControl.Instance.Metrics`
  - Currently supports Additional Lance counts per encounter/contract

## ‚ö° Improvements

- Custom Contract Types: Build File Format Updated
  - The custom contract type build file format is updated as built by the Designer
- [Solo & Duo Duel: OpFor Moves To Engage Before Contact](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/296)
  - Previously the OpFor duelists would sit at their spawn point until contact was made, then they would move to engage the player
  - This led to a boring situation where the player would just jump the enemy
  - Now the OpFor moves to engage the player similar to how the player would move at the start of the contract
- [Extended Boundaries - Support use of only MapId](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/516)
  - Previously, you could provide only `ContractTypeName` and `ContractTypeName` and `MapId` but you couldn't only provide `MapId`
  - You can now only provide `MapId` if required
- [Blackout: Fixed bad turret placement in Phase2 base in Story7 map](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/393)
  - Often the turrets would destroy the buildings they were meant to protect
- [Additional Lances: Follow AI is more limited to Additional Lance lances](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/539)
  - Previously the FollowAI would be injected into the `Core` behaviour tree and `Follow` orders would be sent to all lance units that had the `Employer` tag
  - This didn't affect things like Escort or Defend Base engineers as they didn't use the `Core` AI behaviour tree
  - Now, the AI `Follow` order is sent to any lance units that have both `Employer` and `AdditionalLance` tags - so only the AL lances
- [Data Cleanup: Added new method for cleaning up data from Mission Control](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/382)
  - This new method is now default
  - The old method can be turned on instead if there are some unforseen compatibility issues with other mods in the community
  - In `settings.json`, there is a new setting under `Misc/ContractOverrideDataCleanupMethod`
    - `RestoreFromCopy` is the default and the new cleaning method. It takes copies of LanceOverrides and ObjectiveOverrides and restores them after combat
    - `ScrubData` is the old method. It scans through the contract override and removes anything MC added.
- Contract Type Builder - Added `DurationType` property to OccupyRegion Objective

## üîß Changes

- Contract Type Builder - Refactored `SetStateResult` result to `SetStatusResult`
- Contract Type Builder - Refactored `SetStateAtRandomResult` result to `SetStatusAtRandomResult`

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- [Additional Lances: Ally units Follow AI was breaking after initial contact with enemies](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/420)
  - If an initial encounter was made and at least one enemy unit was destroyed, then contact lost - then the ally AL Follow AI wasn't stripping out dead units for visible/detected enemy checks so the ally AL would break
  - Now, dead units are not considered valid for visible/detected enemy checks
  - Now, [ally AL lances will return to follow mode correctly after contact is lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBhnTauFwV8)
- [Custom Contract Types: Metadata was using wrong heights when plots changed](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/543)
  - Mission Control's custom recalculation of the metadata was running before the custom contract type plots were enabled/disabled
  - This would cause the metadata heights to not always be correct in plot areas that were different to the existing vanilla metadata
