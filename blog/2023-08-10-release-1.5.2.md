This very minor release just fixes some position issues in Blackout maps.

For detailed documentation, visit the [Mission Control Website](https://www.missioncontrolmod.com).

**NOTE: This release is only to officially release out the two hotfix files that were in the MC discord for over half a year. If you already have those there is no need for you to download this release.**

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- [Blackout: Badlands Map - Phase 2 Event 2 invading lance units spawn on top of each other when Random Spawns is off](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/555)
- [Blackout: Badlands Map - Player spawns lance units spawn on top of each other with Random Spawns off](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/557)
- [Blackout: Lowlands Map - Phase 2 Event 2 invading lance units spawn on top of each other when Random Spawns is off](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/issues/559)

## üÜô Upgrade Instructions

This update is just a mod.json and two contractTypeBuild files update.

- If you're using MC without a modpack and none of your own changes, just delete the MC folder and move the new one into your mods folder
- If you're using MC as part of a modpack, let the modpack authors update MC for you (using the below guide)
- If you're using MC without a modpack but you've made some of your own changes to the configs, or you're a modpack author:
  - Copy into your Mods/MissionControl folder
    - mod.json
- Copy and overwrite:
  - `contractTypeBuilds/Blackout/story2_badlandsparched.jsonc`
  - `contractTypeBuilds/Blackout/story7_lowlandsspring.jsonc`

NOTE: There was no dll rebuild for this release so the version on that still says v1.5.1. This is not an issue.
