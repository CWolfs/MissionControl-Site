This release brings in BT 1.8 compatibility and some features and bugfixes. Sadly, I haven't been able to fix the spawn and load issues yet but I am working on it.

Tracked by [Milestone - v0.3.2](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/milestone/9)

## Major Features

- Added BattleTech 1.8 support
- Additional Lances: Added contract rewards for destroying Additional Lance enemy lances.
  - Read the [AL documentation](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/blob/master/docs/additional-lances.md) for the `RewardsPerLance` section. Default is 20% contract value reward.
- Extended Boundaries: Provided more control on the size of the encounter boundaries
  - Read the [EB documentarion](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/blob/master/docs/extended-boundaries.md) for how to control the boundary size.
- Added ability to prevent specific Additional Lance lance configs from autofilling with Extended Lance autofill
  - Read the [AL documentation](https://github.com/CWolfs/MissionControl/blob/master/docs/additional-lances.md) for the `supportAutofill` property.

## Minor Features

- Random Spawns: Provided a setting to turn off random spawns for the original map spawns (Additional Lances and Extended Lances will still spawn according to their spawn profile even with this turned to `false`)

## Bugs Fixed

- Quick Skirmish: Launching into a Quick Skirmish is now fixed. Thanks [KMiSSioN](https://github.com/CMiSSioN)
- Quick Skmirish: Completing a Quick Skirmish fight is now fixed.
